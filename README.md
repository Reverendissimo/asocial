## Usage

### First Time Setup (Encrypted Storage)

1. **Set Key Storage Name**: Enter your key storage name (cannot be changed)
2. **Set Password**: Create a strong password for your encrypted storage
3. **Storage Created**: Your encrypted `.ASoc` storage file is created
4. **Session Authentication**: Password required each time you open the extension

### Creating Writer Keys

1. Click the Asocial extension icon
2. Click "Create New Writer Key"
3. Enter a writer key name (e.g., "Family", "Work", "Close Friends")
4. The extension will generate one RSA-4096 writer key pair for the group

### Sharing Writer Keys

1. In the extension popup, select a group
2. Click "Export Writer Key"
3. Share the **same writer key** with all people in the group via:
   - Export key (includes "magic" key ID for proper decryption)
   - Copy/paste JSON format
   - QR code (future feature)
   - File export (future feature)

### Encrypting Posts

1. Write your post normally on LinkedIn
2. Click the "ðŸ”’ Be Asocial" button that appears

4. Your post will be encrypted and published

### Decrypting Posts

- Posts are automatically decrypted if you have the correct reader key
- Users without the reader key see encrypted content with visual indicators
- Click "Show Encrypted" to view the original encrypted content
- Click "Hide Encrypted" to return to decrypted view

## Security Features

- **RSA-2048 Encryption**: Strong RSA key strength for high security
- **AES-256-GCM**: Advanced symmetric encryption with authentication
- **Secure Key Sharing**: Keys include "magic" key IDs for proper decryption
- **URL Security**: No encrypted content exposure in share URLs
- **CSP Compliance**: Follows LinkedIn's Content Security Policy
- **Argon2id Key Derivation**: Secure key derivation from passphrases
- **SHA-512 Hashing**: Maximum hash security for signatures
- **Local Key Storage**: Keys never leave your device
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Only intended recipients can decrypt

## Architecture

- **Manifest V3**: Latest Chrome extension standard
- **WebCrypto API**: Browser-native cryptographic functions
- **Content Scripts**: Platform-specific integration
- **Background Service Worker**: Extension lifecycle management
- **Popup Interface**: Key management and settings
