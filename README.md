# Asocial - Encrypted Social Posts

A Chrome extension that enables encrypted messaging on social media platforms using high security encryption (RSA-2048, AES-256-GCM) with group-based access control.

## Features

- **High Security Encryption**: RSA-2048 and AES-256-GCM for strong security
- **Group-Based Access Control**: Create encryption groups (Family, Work, Close Friends)
- **Single Shared Key System**: One public key per group - simple and practical
- **LinkedIn Integration**: "Be Asocial" button for easy encryption
- **Automatic Decryption**: Messages are automatically decrypted for authorized users
- **Secure Key Sharing**: Export/import keys with "magic" key IDs for proper decryption
- **Content Security**: No encrypted data exposure in share URLs
- **Toggle Functionality**: "Show Encrypted" button to view original encrypted content
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage with master passphrase protection
- **Cross-Platform Support**: LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter (LinkedIn implemented first)

### Creating Encryption Groups

1. Click the Asocial extension icon
2. Click "Create New Group"
3. Enter a group name (e.g., "Family", "Work", "Close Friends")
4. The extension will generate one RSA-2048 key pair for the group

### Sharing Keys

1. In the extension popup, select a group
2. Click "Export Public Key"
3. Share the **same public key** with all contacts in the group via:
   - Export key (includes "magic" key ID for proper decryption)
   - Copy/paste JSON format
   - QR code (future feature)
   - File export (future feature)

### Encrypting Posts

1. Write your post normally on LinkedIn
2. Click the "ðŸ”’ Be Asocial" button that appears
3. Select which group to encrypt for
4. Your post will be encrypted and published

### Decrypting Posts

- Posts are automatically decrypted if you have the correct key
- Users without the key see encrypted content with visual indicators
- Click "Show Encrypted" to view the original encrypted content
- Click "Hide Encrypted" to return to decrypted view

## Security Features

- **RSA-2048 Encryption**: Strong RSA key strength for high security
- **AES-256-GCM**: Advanced symmetric encryption with authentication
- **Secure Key Sharing**: Keys include "magic" key IDs for proper decryption
- **URL Security**: No encrypted content exposure in share URLs
- **CSP Compliance**: Follows LinkedIn's Content Security Policy
- **Argon2id Key Derivation**: Secure key derivation from passphrases
- **SHA-512 Hashing**: Maximum hash security for signatures
- **Local Key Storage**: Keys never leave your device
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Only intended recipients can decrypt

## Architecture

- **Manifest V3**: Latest Chrome extension standard
- **WebCrypto API**: Browser-native cryptographic functions
- **Content Scripts**: Platform-specific integration
- **Background Service Worker**: Extension lifecycle management
- **Popup Interface**: Key management and settings

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development build with watch
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint code

## Supported Platforms

- âœ… **LinkedIn** (Fully implemented)
- ðŸš§ **Facebook** (Planned)
- ðŸš§ **Twitter** (Planned)

## Security Considerations

- All encryption is performed client-side
- Private keys are never transmitted
- Keys are encrypted with master passphrase
- No server-side key storage
- Open source for security auditing
