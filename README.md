# Asocial - Encrypted Social Posts

A Chrome extension that enables encrypted messaging on social media platforms using high security encryption (RSA-2048, AES-256-GCM) with group-based access control.

## Features

- **High Security Encryption**: RSA-2048 and AES-256-GCM for strong security
- **Group-Based Access Control**: Create encryption groups (Family, Work, Close Friends)
- **Single Shared Key System**: One public key per group - simple and practical
- **LinkedIn Integration**: "Be Asocial" button for easy encryption
- **Automatic Decryption**: Messages are automatically decrypted for authorized users
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage with master passphrase protection
- **Cross-Platform Support**: LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter (LinkedIn implemented first)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the extension: `npm run build`
4. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder

## Usage

### Creating Encryption Groups

1. Click the Asocial extension icon
2. Click "Create New Group"
3. Enter a group name (e.g., "Family", "Work", "Close Friends")
4. The extension will generate one RSA-2048 key pair for the group

### Sharing Keys

1. In the extension popup, select a group
2. Click "Export Public Key"
3. Share the **same public key** with all contacts in the group via:
   - Copy/paste
   - QR code
   - File export

### Encrypting Posts

1. Write your post normally on LinkedIn
2. Click the "ðŸ”’ Be Asocial" button that appears
3. Select which group to encrypt for
4. Your post will be encrypted and published

### Decrypting Posts

- Posts are automatically decrypted if you have the correct key
- Users without the key see encrypted content with visual indicators

## Security Features

- **RSA-4096 Encryption**: Maximum RSA key strength for military-grade security
- **AES-256-GCM**: Advanced symmetric encryption with authentication
- **Argon2id Key Derivation**: Secure key derivation from passphrases
- **SHA-512 Hashing**: Maximum hash security for signatures
- **Local Key Storage**: Keys never leave your device
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Only intended recipients can decrypt

## Architecture

- **Manifest V3**: Latest Chrome extension standard
- **WebCrypto API**: Browser-native cryptographic functions
- **Content Scripts**: Platform-specific integration
- **Background Service Worker**: Extension lifecycle management
- **Popup Interface**: Key management and settings

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development build with watch
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Package for distribution
npm run package
```

## Supported Platforms

- âœ… **LinkedIn** (Fully implemented)
- ðŸš§ **Facebook** (Planned)
- ðŸš§ **Twitter** (Planned)

## Security Considerations

- All encryption is performed client-side
- Private keys are never transmitted
- Keys are encrypted with master passphrase
- No server-side key storage
- Open source for security auditing
