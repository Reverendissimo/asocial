- **Encrypted Local Storage**: All keys stored in password-protected `.ASoc` files
- **Multi-User Support**: Separate encrypted vaults for different users
- **Session Authentication**: Password required each time you open the extension
- **Writer Key System**: Create writer keys (Family, Work, Close Friends) for encrypting your messages
- **Reader Key System**: Import reader keys from others to decrypt their messages
- **Universal Contextual Menu**: Right-click any selected text â†’ "Encrypt with Asocial"
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Reddit, Discord, Slack, and ANY website
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Ctrl+Shift+E to automatically select all text and encrypt
- **Automatic Text Selection**: Ctrl+Shift+E automatically selects all text in current input field
- **Automatic Pasting**: Encrypted text is automatically pasted after encryption
- **Automatic Decryption**: Messages are automatically decrypted for authorized users
- **Simple Text Display**: Decrypted messages show as `[ASOCIAL] decrypted text`
- **Secure Key Sharing**: Export/import keys with "magic" key IDs for proper decryption
- **No DOM Breaking**: Simple text replacement that doesn't break websites

1. In the extension popup, select a group
2. Click "Export Writer Key"
3. Share the **same writer key** with all people in the group via:
   - Export key (includes "magic" key ID for proper decryption)
   - Copy/paste JSON format
   - QR code (future feature)
   - File export (future feature)

### Encrypting Messages

**Method 1: Keyboard Shortcut (Recommended)**
1. **Click in any text input field** (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Reddit, Discord, etc.)
2. **Press Ctrl+Shift+E** - automatically selects all text and shows encryption modal
3. **Choose writer key** from the modal
4. **Text is encrypted and pasted automatically**

**Method 2: Right-Click Menu**

2. **Right-click** â†’ "Encrypt with Asocial"
3. **Choose writer key** from the modal
4. **Text is encrypted and pasted automatically**

### Decrypting Messages

- **Decrypted messages** show as `[ASOCIAL] decrypted message text`
- **Encrypted messages** show as `[ASOCIAL ENCRYPTED] encrypted message text`
- **Automatic decryption** if you have the correct reader key
- **Simple text display** that doesn't break websites
