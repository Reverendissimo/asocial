## Core Workflow Clarification

**User Experience Flow:**
1. User writes post normally on LinkedIn
2. "Be Asocial" button appears next to the post button
3. Clicking "Be Asocial" shows encryption key selection dropdown
4. User selects which key group to encrypt for (e.g., "Family", "Work", "Close Friends")
5. Post is encrypted with selected key group and published with [ASOCIAL MESSAGE] tag
6. Only recipients with the correct public key can decrypt the content
7. Recipients without the extension see encrypted content with visual indicators

## Key Management Architecture

**Encryption Approach:**
- **You have multiple private keys** (one per key group: "Family", "Work", "Close Friends")
- **Each key group has its own public key** (distributed to specific contacts)
- **When encrypting a post:**
  1. Select which key group to encrypt for
  2. Generate random AES-256 symmetric key
  3. Encrypt post content with symmetric key
  4. Encrypt symmetric key with selected group's private key
  5. Create payload: `[encrypted_content] + [encrypted_symmetric_key]` (only that group can decrypt)

**Decryption Approach:**
- Only contacts with the correct public key can decrypt
- Decrypt the symmetric key, then decrypt the post content
- **Group-based encryption: only selected group can decrypt**

The project is now ready for implementation with all requirements clearly defined.
