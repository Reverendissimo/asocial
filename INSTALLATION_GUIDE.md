   - When you visit a page with encrypted messages, they're automatically decrypted
   - Decrypted messages appear with `[ASOCIAL]` prefix and green styling
   - Only messages you can decrypt (with matching reader keys) will be shown

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check Extension is Enabled**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Make sure Asocial is enabled
   - Check for any error messages

2. **Reload the Extension**
   - Click the reload button on the extension
   - Try again

### Encryption Not Working

1. **Check You Have Writer Keys**
   - Open the extension popup
   - Make sure you have at least one writer key
   - Create one if needed

2. **Check Keyboard Shortcut**
   - Make sure you're pressing `Ctrl+Shift+E` (or `Cmd+Shift+E` on Mac)
   - Try selecting text first, then pressing the shortcut

### Decryption Not Working

1. **Check You Have Reader Keys**
   - Open the extension popup
   - Make sure you have reader keys for the messages you're trying to decrypt
   - Add the sender's reader key if needed

2. **Check Message Format**
   - Encrypted messages should start with `[ASOCIAL MAGIC_CODE]`
   - If the format is wrong, decryption won't work

### KeyStore Issues

1. **Forgot Password**
   - Unfortunately, KeyStore passwords cannot be recovered
   - You'll need to create a new KeyStore and re-add your keys

2. **KeyStore Not Loading**

   - Check if you're entering the correct password

- **Keep Your Passwords Safe**: KeyStore passwords cannot be recovered
- **Backup Your Keys**: Export your keys and store them safely
- **Use Strong Passwords**: At least 8 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the Console**
   - Press F12 to open Developer Tools
   - Look for error messages in the Console tab
   - Take a screenshot of any errors
